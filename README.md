## Summary

The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in worldly life has progressively become more important, if not mandatory within certain application contexts, over the years.

GPS is still the main technology that uses GNSS and there are many applications: real-time navigation on maps, unlocking smart doors (Auto Unlock by Nuki), unlocking cars on approach (Tesla model S / X) , control / security functions on personnel in a company or on goods shipped.

In all these sectors, security is important and cannot be overshadowed, GPS spoofing is precisely a type of cyber attack that aims to falsify the location of a device.

This thesis aims to study a possible safety mechanism for tracking devices, combining high precision positioning techniques and Bluetooth technology.
